### Done tasts:

* GCD and it's faster versions [1], [12]
* Fermat prime test and other better prime numbers tests [2], [3]
* Sieve of Eratosthenes
* Sieve of Atkin [5]
* Lucky numbers sieve [4]
* **6 types** of hypercomplex numbers, which based on `clifford_algebras.base`
  see realisation in `clifford_algebras.hypercomplex.py`
* **12 types** of hypercomplex numbers, which based on Cayleyâ€“Dickson construction `clifford_algebras.cayley_dickson.py`
  see realisation in `clifford_algebras.composition_algebras.py` [7]
* exp(), log() and pow() functions for any Clifford algebras. [6]
* q-Analogs of mathematical functions. See realisation in `mathematics.q_math.py` [10], [11]
* Localizations. See realisation in `algebra.rings.py`  [8]
* Finite fields. See realisation in `algebra.rings.py` [9]

### Future plans:

* p-adic numbers
* clifford algebras support for q-analogs
* better GCD for localizations (for other data types)
