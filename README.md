#### Roadmap
* ``makima: core`` -- core for working with all makima-like projects
* to makima-lize _fractals_ and _onim_
---

There is some programms on Python and R:


#### Samples and lessons:
``data sciense on R``  
``are you normal`` -- normality tests on Python  
``misc`` -- other (not) interesting code  

#### Mathematical projects:
``abstractpy`` is my first mathematical package for abstract algebra calculations  
``makima`` is package of some extended mathematcal functions  
``makima²`` is web mathematical calculator  

#### Physics projects:
``flüssigkeitsraketentriebwerk`` -- ballistics  
``planets_2d`` -- calculation of planetary motion with managed law of gravity  
``weltraum`` -- calculation of point mass motion near charged & rotating black hole  
``stakhanisator`` -- atom motion calculation
``voronoi_diagram``  

#### Something beautiful
``fractals`` -- quasi-genetic generator of plant images  
``onim`` -- neural appraisal for name generator project (in progress)

#### Algorithmic
``stringmatching`` -- algorithms for CPU/GPU-optimized text search
